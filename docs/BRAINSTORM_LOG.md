# Brainstorm log

Read by the daily improvement-ideas routine so it does not re-suggest
what is already done, in progress, or deliberately rejected. Updated by
the local Claude session as things ship. Newest first.

## Shipped (do not re-suggest)

- One-click sample report link in the hero (M1 1AE), zero-typing route
  into the product.
- Globe intro and Leaflet self-hosted under /static/vendor/; no scripts
  from CDNs anywhere, pinned by a test.
- Area guides link to their regional price league page.
- School pages and the schools guide cross-link to the district's
  private-schools page.
- /schools/outstanding: targets "ofsted outstanding schools near me"
  with real register counts, per-region table, top districts.

- Per-school pages de-duplicated: lead with each school's own data
  (roll, capacity, EAL, destinations, result trends). 73% shared
  phrasing down to 53%.
- Private-school area pages de-duplicated (64% down to 53%).
- 12 per-region price league pages (/market/house-prices/{region}).
- Comparison (vs) pages: first 35 pairs in the sitemap, earn-gated.
- Sitemap curated and grown on Search Console evidence only: 505
  districts as of 31 Aug 2026.
- Titles under 60 chars via seo_title(); descriptions under 155.
- Review ask at the foot of every report (in product, not email).
- /embed backlink offer on the price pages.
- Postcode autocomplete on every search box.
- 202 cold-report waits recorded as synthetic pageviews.
- Admin page: test accounts excluded everywhere, per-day traffic
  shape-checked for automation, honest unflagged average.
- Bot filter widened (HTTP libraries, headless, AI crawlers).
- Hero de-slopped: stats row and count-up numbers removed.
- New-account welcome banner; pricing CTAs land on search, not
  the price list.
- Trustpilot: verbatim quotes plus plain link ONLY (their brand rules
  prohibit scores, stars, counts outside their widgets; enforced).
- Extension 2.2.0: OnTheMarket detection, miles not km, no silent
  failure; store page linked from /browser-extension.
- District following (watch an outcode) with visit-time diffs.
- Printable viewing checklist; share-a-report with a sender note.

## In progress or queued (do not re-suggest as new)

- Report page DOM reduction (21k nodes) - separate session, approved.
- Crime months as "May 2026" not "2026-05" - separate session.
- B2B agency tier: owner emailing the comped agency power user.
- Extension Reddit post: waiting for 2.2.0 store review.
- Google Ads £30-50 experiment: awaiting owner decision.

## On hold by the owner (suggest only if new evidence)

- Press pitch outreach (drafted, held).
- Weekly GSC export loop (tooling ready, held).
- Trustpilot email invites (held).

## Rejected on principle (never suggest)

- Any third-party script on the site (privacy page promises none run;
  this killed the Trustpilot widget and any analytics snippet).
- Scheduled or promotional emails without a fresh opt-in (change-alert
  emails promise "never on a schedule").
- Trustpilot scores, stars or review counts rendered by us.
- Features without a reliable official data source (no modelling, no
  estimates): HS2 corridors, rights of way, planning applications
  (until planning.data.gov.uk covers ~50+ councils).
- Submitting all 2,943 districts to the sitemap at once.
- Em-dashes or exclamation marks in user-facing copy.
